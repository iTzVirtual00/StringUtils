This is just a little project, the first i would say, that I don't randomly upload to github without context.

# What's this
I created a bunch of methods you can interface using `dbus` structure. From base64 encoding and decoding to simple hashing algorithms. I also wrote an "handler" to make the methods available directly from krunner in my plasma desktop environment.

# Just... Why
I initially made this script to encode and decode strings without opening a python terminal or external websites but directly from the krunner.
I ended up learning a new IPC method.
